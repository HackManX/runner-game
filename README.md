# 🎧 Audio Racer – Audio-Based Game for the Visually Impaired

A unique and inclusive audio-only game created using **Vite + React + Tailwind CSS**, designed especially for the visually impaired. Players navigate traffic lanes using stereo sound cues and make decisions with a simple tap or key press.

## 🧠 Problem & Our Solution

**Problem**: Visually impaired users often lack access to meaningful gaming experiences because games are heavily visual and complex in controls.

**Solution**: We designed a simple, sound-based game that uses stereo audio to indicate the direction of approaching cars. Players use their hearing and quick decision-making to switch lanes using just one input (a tap or key), making the experience accessible and enjoyable.
